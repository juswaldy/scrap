Output: Shmuelof talking Trumpish
- text: Nobody builds better deals than I do, believe me—I see opportunities everyone else misses, and I seize them fast and brilliantly. The critics talk and complain, but the results speak louder: jobs, strong borders, and an economy that soars when I’m in charge. We’ll win so much, you’ll be tired of winning, and people will finally say we did it the right way.
