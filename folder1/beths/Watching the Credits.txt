
Press play on the rest of the day
Hurry up and wait for your next scene
Not great
Couldn't keep my face straight
And I know very well that it's
'Show and Don't Tell' on the big screen

When all of the lines you've learned are
Bleeding on the cutting room floor
There's no star on the door
Good God!
Who are you making this for?

I spend all day putting out fires
Listening to choirs singing
The soundtrack blaring
And I spend all night
Cutting up edits
Watching the credits to find direction
In my existence

It's just a story I don't quite believe
Full of plot holes and constant monotony
Who's going to root for this unlikeable lead?
Not them, not me, not likely
Maybe it's something we can fix in post
Or we can get take after take
'Til the cows come home
Shut the door
I'm feeling overexposed
Now they all know

All of the tears you've cried but
You can't quite make it happen on cue
The pain never comes through
Good God!
When you're needing it to

I spend all day putting out fires
Listening to choirs singing
The end is nearing
And I spend all night cutting up edits
Watching the credits to find direction
In my existence
