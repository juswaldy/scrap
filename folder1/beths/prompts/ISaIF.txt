Amidst the sun's fading light, shadows fall,
A hurried world, heedless of nature's call.
Not great, the price we pay for progress' gain,
Struggling souls, estranged from nature's domain.
The silver screen, a spectacle of show,
Hides deeper truths we're meant to know.
Lines of discontent, bleeding on life's floor,
Rejection's mark, a society's closed door.
For whom this tale of industrial might,
A riddle posed, our humanity's plight.
Fires to quench, a relentless race,
Choirs' sweet songs lost in this crowded space.
The blaring noise, drowning nature's sound,
As night descends, our souls are bound.
Credits roll, direction sought in vain,
A purpose lost, amidst progress' chain.
A story woven, filled with strife,
Monotonous cycles, draining life.
An unlikeable path, we blindly tread,
In post, redemption's chance lies ahead.
Shutting doors on the truth we hide,
Overexposed, our souls denied.
Tears unshed, emotions suppressed,
The pain unseen, a silent protest.
All day we toil, industrial hymns play,
The end is nearing, nature's dismay.
In edits, we find a future obscured,
An industrial society, its future secured.
